# Interactive visualization of swimming training time

As a swimmer, it is important to know how to achieve the best result in the swimming competition. Even if all the swimmers train the same amount of time, the result will vary for each person. The objective of this project is to analyze the training data and the competition result for each swimmer and suggest the best training routine to produce the best result for each of them.

Given the training times of an individual for each swimming stroke; freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and sidestroke, save them into a database. Visualize the training time for each month, week, or day so that the swimmers can have different options to visualize how much they have trained. Compare and analyze the recently saved training time and result, with the previously recorded training times and results. By doing so, the algorithm can figure out how much more or less time the swimmers should spend on each training category.
